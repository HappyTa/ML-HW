## Question 1

### (a)

***i***: Why does the class hierarchy we designed require us to include $\vec(y)$ as a function parameter for training? What are some things users can do to avoid this being a problem when call the K-Mean cluster train function? If the training function never uses $\vec(y)$ in any of its lines of code, then why does it ultimately not matter what the user does?
